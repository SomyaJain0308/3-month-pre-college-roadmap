"""
In a file called fuel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a fraction, formatted as X/Y, wherein X is a non-negative integer and Y is a positive integer,
and then outputs, as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer, how much fuel is in the tank. If, though, 1% or less remains, output E instead to indicate that the
tank is essentially empty. And if 99% or more remains, output F instead to indicate that the tank is essentially full.

If, though, X or Y is not an integer, X is greater than Y, or Y is 0, instead prompt the user again. (It is not necessary for Y to be 4.) Be sure to catch any
exceptions like ValueError or ZeroDivisionError.
